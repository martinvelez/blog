Last week, I attended the [Verification Mentorship Workshop
(VMW)](http://i-cav.org/2016/vmw/) held at [CAV 2016](http://i-cav.org/2016/).
CAV is a conference where researchers meet to present and discuss advances in
computer-aided verification.  It is one of the top conferences in the field of
formal methods and in computer science.  This year it was held in Toronto,
Ontario, Canada.  VMW is a full-day workshop where graduate students meet
researchers and learn about the problems being adddressed by the CAV community.

The morning speakers in VMW talked about major research themes in Formal
Methods.  The first speaker was Kenneth Mcmillan from Microsoft Research.  He
talked about Model Checking.  Then followed Nikolaj Bjorner, also from
Microsoft Research and one of the creators of the Z3 theorem prover.  He talked
about the history of SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and First-order Theorem provers.  

In the afternoon, three researchers working Academia, Research Lab, and
Industry talked about their career paths.  Ruzica Piskac, an assistant
professor at Yale, spoke about why she left industry to join academia.  Arie
Gurfinkel describe what it is like to conduct research at a research lab, SEI
CMU.  Finally, Franjo Ivancic, told us about his experience at Google.  There
was a panel session with additional researchers working at Amazon, Apple,
Google, and Microsoft.



Overall, my experience at VMW and CAV was enlightening.  I gained a better understanding of the challenges in Formal Methods, and was able to learn about approaches being used by researchers around the world.

Last week, I attended the [Verification Mentorship Workshop
(VMW)](http://i-cav.org/2016/vmw/) held at [CAV 2016](http://i-cav.org/2016/).
CAV is a conference where researchers meet to discuss their work in
computer-aided verification.  It is one of the top conferences in the field of
formal methods and in computer science.  This year it was held in Toronto,
Ontario, Canada.  VMW is a full-day workshop where graduate students meet junior
and senior researchers and learn about the problems being adddressed by the CAV
community.

The morning session of VMW focused on the major research themes in Formal
Methods.  Kenneth Mcmillan, from Microsoft Research, talked about model checking
and the types of strategies researchers use.  Nikolaj Bjorner, also from
Microsoft Research and one of the creators of the Z3 theorem prover, followed
with a history of SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and First-order Theorem provers.
Anna Zaks, from Apple, gave a talk about how Apple uses static analysis to
develop checkers and in the development of Swift.  Sriram Sankaranarayanan
closed the morning session with a talk on verifying cyber-physical systems. 

The afternoon session focused on career management.  Three researchers working
in academia, a research Lab, and in industry talked about their individual
career paths.  Ruzica Piskac, an assistant professor at Yale, spoke about why
she left industry to join academia.  Arie Gurfinkel describe what it is like to
conduct research at a research lab, SEI.  Finally, Franjo Ivancic, told us about
his experience at Google and about the importance of reviewing undergraduate
computer science material for technical interviews.  There was a panel session
with additional researchers working at Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft.

The chairs, Azadeh Farzan and Swarat Chaudhuri, finished the workshop with
lessons about reviewing papers and applying for funding.  In his talk, Swarat
introduced me to The
[Heilmeier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Heilmeier) Questions:

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2. How is it done today?  What are the limits in the current way?
3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful??
4. Who cares?  If you are successful, what difference will it make?
5. How much will it cost?  How long will it take?

On Tuesday, Pavol Bielik gave an interesting overview of machine learning
programs. 
  
The main CAV conference took place from Wednesday through Saturday.  I attended
most technical research presentations.  I especially enjoyed the talk gave by my
lab colleague, [Zhoulai Fu](http://zhoulaifu.com/), titled "[XSat: A Fast
Floating-Point Satisfiability
Solver](http://zhoulaifu.com/wp-content/papercite-data/pdf/xsat.pdf)".  In this
paper, Fu and Su present a reduction from floating-point satisfiability to
mathematical optimization.

Overall, my experience at VMW and CAV was enlightening.  I gained a better
understanding of the challenges in Formal Methods.  I learned about approaches
being used by researchers around the world in addressing these challenges.  And
I made new friends!  I thank the organizers, [Aarti
Gupta](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~aartig/), [Ruzica
Piskac](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/piskac/), and [Andrey
Rybalchenko](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rybal/) for making
it possible.

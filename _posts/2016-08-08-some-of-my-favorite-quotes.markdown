Often, we think ideas and have feelings but lack the words to express them.  I
believe that, as humans, we experience the world similarly.  Sometimes, someone
else finds the right words to express what you are feeling.  This is why I enjoy
reading and collecting quotes.

- Stephen M.R. Covey, The Speed of Trust: The One Thing that Changes Everything

> "Years of love have been forgot, in the hatred of a minute." 

- Edgar Allan Poe

work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.

> "However, I continue to try and I continue, indefatigably, to reach out.

difference - but how ashamed I would be to let a day pass without making one
more effort." 

- Isaac Asimov

> "Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world. Indeed
it is the only thing that ever has".

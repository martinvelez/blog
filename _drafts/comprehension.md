## Introduction

child reads passage.
quiz on comprehesion.
higher better.

child reads many passages.
quiz on comprehension.
higher better.

college student takes class.
final exam.
higher better.


If some tool X promised to raise the mean score of the quizzes and exams, would you use it?

Probably would not change score distribution much.
Strong students would still perform well.
Weak students would still perfrom poorly.
Other factors.

Does increasing overall comprehension or test performance matter in the long run?
Does increasing the number of facts learned matter?
In the long run?

Hypothesis: 
Yes, if solving future problems depend on facts learned.
Yes, if fact learned is not forgotten or forgotten easily.

Idea:
A learns X.
B does not learn X.
C learns X and Y.

A, B, and C forget with 50% probability.

New problem requires knowing X.
A can solve with 50% probability.
B cannot solve.
C can solve with 50% probability.

New problem requires knowing X and Y.
A cannot solve.
B cannot solve.
C can solve with 25% probability.

Does learning more facts decrease long-term memory retention?
